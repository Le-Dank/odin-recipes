    <h2>How To Make Chicken Tacos</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      Personally, I can’t get enough of tacos in every shape and form. That
      being said, when I'm looking for something simple to load up with all of
      my favorite toppings, I turn to these simple chicken tacos. While far from
      being authentic, these Americanized tacos load up corn tortillas with
      seasoned chicken and any variety of toppings to make your perfect taco.
      Pair with a classic margarita, and your Taco Tuesday (or Wednesday, or
      Thursday…) will be more than complete.
